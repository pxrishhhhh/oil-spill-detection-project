Oil Spill Detection Using U-Net & Streamlit
This project implements a U-Net–based deep learning model to detect oil spills from SAR satellite imagery (Sentinel-1 & PALSAR).
It also includes a Streamlit web app for visualizing predictions and estimating spill severity.

 How to Run the Streamlit App

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
Train the U-Net Model
python unet_model/train_unet.py
 Model Features
U-Net architecture for segmentation

Works with SAR images (Sentinel & PALSAR)

Generates binary spill masks

Severity estimation by area calculation

Streamlit UI for end-to-end visualization

Dataset
The dataset used is the SOS SAR Oil Spill Dataset (CBDNet) containing:

Sentinel SAR images

PALSAR SAR images

Corresponding ground-truth masks

Dataset is not uploaded in this repo due to size. Download from the official source.
